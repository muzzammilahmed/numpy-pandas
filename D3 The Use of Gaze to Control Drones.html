<b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
This paper presents an experimental investigation of gaze-based control modes for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or “drones”). Ten participants performed a simple flying task. We gathered empirical measures, including task completion time, and examined the user experience for difficulty, reliability, and fun. Four control modes were tested, with each mode applying a combination of x-y gaze movement and manual (keyboard) input to control speed (pitch), altitude, rotation (yaw), and drafting (roll). Participants had similar task completion times for all four control modes, but one combination was considered significantly more reliable than the others. We discuss design and performance issues for the gaze-plus-manual split of controls when drones are operated using gaze in conjunction with tablets, near-eye displays (glasses), or monitors.<p>

<H2>1 Introduction</H2>
<p>

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or “drones” have a long history in military 
applications. They are able to carry heavy loads over long distances, while 
being controlled remotely by an operator. However, low-cost drones are now 
offering many non-military possibilities. These drones are light-weight, fly 
only a limited time (e.g., &lt; 20 minutes), and have limited range (e.g., &lt; 1 
km). For instance, the off-the-shelf A.R. Parrot drone costs around $400 and 
can be controlled from a PC, tablet, or smartphone (Figure 1). It has a 
front-facing camera transmitting live-images to the pilot via Wi-Fi. People 
share videos, tips, and new software applications supported by its open-API.
<p>


This paper considers gaze as a potential input in the development of 
interfaces for drone piloting. When using gaze input for drone control, 
spatial awareness is directly conveyed without being mediated through another 
input device. The pilot sees what the drone sees. However, it is an open 
research question how best to include gaze in the command of drones. If gaze 
is too difficult to use, people may crash or lose the drones, which is 
dangerous and costly.
<p>


First we present our motivation with examples of use-cases where gaze could 
offer a significant contribution. Then we present previous research within the 
area. We designed an experiment to get feedback from users on their immediate, 
first-time impression of gaze-controlled flying. The experiment is presented 
in section 5. The paper then finishes with general discussion on how best to utilize gaze for drone control.<p>
