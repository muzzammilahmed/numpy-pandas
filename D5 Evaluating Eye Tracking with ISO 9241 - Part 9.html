<b>Abstract</b><br>
The ISO 9241-9 standard for computer pointing devices proposes an evaluation of performance and comfort [4]. This paper is the first eye tracking evaluation conforming to ISO 9241-9. We evaluated three techniques and compared them with a standard mouse. The evaluation used throughput (in bits/s) as a measurement of user performance in a multi-directional point-select task. The "Eye Tracking Long" technique required participants to look at an on-screen target and dwell on it for 750 ms for selection. Results revealed a lower throughput than for the "Eye Tracking Short" technique with a 500 ms dwell time. The "Eye+Spacebar" technique allowed participants to "point" with the eye and "select" by pressing the spacebar upon fixation. This eliminated the need to wait for selection. It was the best among the three eye tracking techniques with a throughput of 3.78 bits/s, which was close to the 4.68 bits/s for the mouse.

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>

Beginning with the Apple <I>Macintosh</I> in 1984, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have 
evolved and matured. The key feature of modern GUIs is the ability for users to 
interact with simple point-and-select operations. The most common pointing device in 
desktop systems is the mouse. To select an on-screen target with a mouse, a user 
manipulates the mouse to maneuver the cursor to a target, then selects the target by 
pressing and releasing a button. Simple as this seems, the interaction is even simpler 
with an eye tracker. The user locates the target by looking at it and follows 
immediately with selection [10].
<p>

Although considerable research exists in eye tracking [3, 6, 9, 10], none has evaluated 
eye tracking with <I>ISO 9241 Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual 
display terminals (VDTs) - Part 9: Requirements for non-keyboard input devices</I>. 
ISO 9241-9 establishes uniform guidelines and testing procedures for evaluating 
computer pointing devices. The metric for comparison is <I>Throughput</I>, in bits per 
second (bits/s), which includes both the speed and accuracy of users' performance. 
The equation for throughput is Fitts' Index of Performance except using an <I>effective</I> 
index of difficulty (<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub>). Specifically,
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<i>Throughput</i> = <i>ID</i><sub>e</sub> / <I>MT</I>
<td width=10% align=right>
(1)
</table>
<p>

where <I>MT</I> is the mean movement time, in seconds, for all trials within the same 
condition, and
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub> = log<sub>2</sub>(<I>D</I> / <I>W</I><sub>e</sub> + 1).
<td width=10% align=right>
(2)
</table>
<p>

<I>ID</I><sub>e</sub>, in bits, is calculated from <I>D</I>, the distance to the target, and 
<I>W</I><sub>e</sub>, the effective width 
of the target. <I>W</I><sub>e</sub> is calculated as
<p>

<table width=90%>
<tr>
<td width=10%>
<td width=80%>
<I>W</I><sub>e</sub> = 4.133 × <I>SD</I>.
<td width=10% align=right>
(3)
</table>
<p>

where <I>SD</I> is the standard deviation in the selection coordinates measured along the 
line from the center of the home square to the center of a target. Using effective width 
allows throughput to incorporate the spatial variability in human performance. It 
includes both speed and accuracy [5].

<h3>Prior Evaluations</h3>

ISO 9241-9 was in Draft International Standard form in 1998 and became an 
International Standard in 2000. If one considers mouse evaluations in research not 
following the standard, throughput ranged from about 2.6 bits/s to 12.5 bits/s. On the 
contrary, studies conforming to the standard reported throughput from about 3.7 bits/s 
to 4.9 bits/s [8]. The data appear much more uniform and consistent. In short, 
ISO 9241-9 improves the quality and comparability of device evaluations. 
<p>

Although several papers follow ISO 9241-9 and dozens of others use Fitts' law to 
evaluate non-keyboard input devices, Ware and Mikaelian published in 1987 what 
remains the only Fitts' law evaluation of an eye tracking system [10]. They used a 
serial Fitts' law task to test three eye tracking techniques. Task completion time was 
the only performance measure used. They compared eye tracking with the mouse but 
did not calculate or report on throughput as a performance measure. No eye tracking 
evaluation paper has ever been published since then using Fitts' law (or ISO 9241-9). 
<p>

By following the standard and comparing throughput for eye tracking with a baseline 
technique (i.e., a mouse), we can determine how good an eye tracking system is. This 
paper is the first eye tracking evaluation conforming to ISO 9241-9.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we described the 
methodology of our experiment. In section 3, the results are presented and discussed. Finally, we present our conclusions in section 4.<p>
