<b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
We describe a study on how auditory and visual feedback affects eye typing. Results show that the feedback method influences both text entry speed and error rate. In addition, a proper feedback mode facilitates eye typing by reducing the user's need to switch her gaze between the on-screen keyboard and the typed text field.

<h2>INTRODUCTION
</h2>
<p>
For people with severe disabilities their eyes may be the only means for communication. Even though eye typing has been studied for many years, there is little research on design issues [2]. Our goal was to study how feedback could facilitate the tedious [1] eye typing task and make gaze-based computer-aided communication more practical for those who need it.
<p>

<h3>
Feedback Modes
</h3>

<p>
During eye typing the user first focuses on the desired letter. To select the focused letter she continues to fixate on it thus using dwell time as an activation command. Feedback is given for focus and selection. The following four feedback modes were tested. 
<p>

<b>Visual only.</b> In the Visual only mode, the key is highlighted on focus (the 2nd key on left in Figure 1) and its symbol shrinks as dwell time elapses. The shrinking draws the attention in, helping the user focus on the center of the key. On selection the letter turns red and the key goes down. 
<p>

<p>

<b>Speech only.</b> The Speech only mode did not use visual feedback. The symbol on the key was spoken on selection.
<p>

<b>Click plus visual.</b> The Click plus visual mode uses two modalities; it has the same visual feedback seen in Figure 1 and, in addition, a short "click" is heard on selection.
<p>

<b>Speech plus visual.</b> The Speech plus visual mode again uses the same visual feedback plus the symbol on the key is spoken on selection.
