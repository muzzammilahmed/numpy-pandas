<b>Abstract</b><br>
Eye typing provides a means of communication that is especially useful for people with disabilities. However, most related research addresses technical issues in eye typing systems, and largely ignores design issues. This paper reports experiments studying the impact of auditory and visual feedback on user performance and experience. Results show that feedback impacts typing speed, accuracy, gaze behavior, and subjective experience. Also, the feedback should be matched with the dwell time. Short dwell times require simplified feedback to support the typing rhythm, whereas long dwell times allow extra information on the eye typing process. Both short and long dwell times benefit from combined visual and auditory feedback. Six guidelines for designing feedback for gaze-based text entry are provided.

<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>

Eye typing refers to the production of text using the focus of the eye (aka gaze) as a means of input. It is especially needed by people with severe disabilities,
where controlling the eyes is sometimes the only means of interaction with the world. Their need for an effective communication system is acute.
<p>

Research on technical aspects of eye typing extends
over 20 years. However, there is little research on design
issues [16]. The authors’ work [17, 18, 19] is an attempt
to partly fill this gap. Such work investigated how feedback
can facilitate the tedious [5] eye typing task. This
paper summarizes the results of three experiments
studying various aspects of feedback during eye typing.
Because gaze has some unique features, the paper
briefly introduces gaze as an input method. This is followed
by a description of eye typing. Examples of the
most relevant research on eye gaze feedback are reviewed.
The methods and results of the experiments are
then presented, followed by guidelines gleaned from the
results.
<p>

<h3>1.1 Gaze input</h3>
<p>

Gaze is naturally used to obtain visual information. For
example, gaze location shows the focus of attention [13].
As an input method, gaze has both advantages and
disadvantages. It is a natural mode of input as it is easy
to focus on items by looking at them [12, 25]. Another
advantage is that target acquisition using gaze is very
fast, provided the targets are su.ciently large [26].
However, gaze is not as accurate as the mouse.
Inaccuracy originates partly from technological reasons
and partly from features of the eye [12]. The size of the
fovea and the inability of the remote camera to resolve
the fovea position restricts the accuracy of the measured
point of gaze to about 0.5 degrees, equivalent to a region
spanning approximately 15 pixels on a typical display
(17 inch display with a resolution of 1,024 &times; 768 pixels
viewed from a distance of 70&nbsp;cm). One problem is
drifting; even if a newly calibrated eye tracking device is
accurate at first, with continued use the measured point
of gaze drifts away from the actual point of gaze. This is
partly due to the technology and partly due to the
interaction between head movement and eye movement.
Therefore, the practical accuracy with about 0.5–1 degree of
drifting corresponds to about 1–1.5 cm on the screen at
a normal viewing distance.
<p>

When we look at things, we fixate (focus) on them,
with fixations typically lasting from 200 to 600 ms [12].
For a computer to distinguish whether the user is
looking at an object to obtain information or to select it,
an interval longer than the typical fixation interval is
needed. Stampe and Reingold [25] used a dwell time (an
extended look at the object) of 750&nbsp;ms in their eye typing
study. A thousand milliseconds is usually long enough to
prevent false selections. For simple tasks, 700&nbsp;ms or less
is enough. Requiring the user to fixate for long intervals
is good for preventing false selections (thus, preventing
the so-called Midas touch problem [11]), but this is
uncomfortable for most users [25].
<p>

It is important to note that the use of a dwell time
criterion for key selection places an upper limit on eye
typing speed. In other words, no amount of skill
acquisition will allow a user to "eye press keys" at a rate
faster than 1&nbsp;/&nbsp;<I>t</I><sub>d</sub>, where td is the dwell time. If, for
example, <I>t</I><sub>d</sub> = 1,000&nbsp;ms = 1&nbsp;s, the upper limit for typing
speed is (60&nbsp;/&nbsp;1)&nbsp;/&nbsp;5 = 12 words per minute (wpm)
(following the accepted method in computing typing
speed of 1 word = 5 inputted characters).
<p>

<h3>1.2 Typing by gaze</h3>
<p>

A typical setup has an eye tracker and an on-screen
keyboard (see Fig.&nbsp;1). The tracking device follows the
user’s point of gaze and software records and analyses
the gaze behavior. Based on the analysis, the system
decides which letter the user wants to type.
During eye typing, the user first locates the letter by
moving his or her gaze (focus) to it. When using dwell
time for selection, the user continues to look at the letter
for a pre-defined time interval. Feedback is typically shown on both focus and selection (for a review, see [16]).<p>
